how GitOps helped and where systems broke down, to end user talks 
around GitOps implementations, to how some convinced larger 
orgnaizations to adopt GitOps, how to's, and more - there's something 
for everyone.

Come join us as we hear talks from by Deutsche Telekom, Flipt,
Kubesimplify, Orange, Venafi, and many more about how GitOps is shaping their
